# TensorFlow-Certificate-Preparation

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jinglan-shi/deepbedmap/)

This is just to show my material and excercises implemented following the construction of Zero to Mastery TensorFlow for Deep Learning as a preparation for Google TensorFlow Developer Certificate, which mainly covers the following topics:
1. TensorFlow developer skills
2. Building and training Neural Network Models using TensorFlow 2.x
3. Image Classification
4. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
5. Time series, sequences and predictions

You can find my progress through the badge above.

This repository is dependent on TensorFlow 2.x based on Google Colab online platform. 
In this course, I used the free GPU service available from Coogle Colab to accelerate the model training process, 
while I am challenged by the fact of no respectable runtime and memory since there is no GPU Pro+ service provided in my region (currently the Netherlands).
