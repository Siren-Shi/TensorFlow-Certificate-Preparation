# TensorFlow-Certificate-Preparation

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jinglan-shi/TensorFlow-Certificate-Preparation/)

This is just to show my material and excercises implemented following the construction of [Zero to Mastery TensorFlow for Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/) as a preparation for Google TensorFlow Developer Certificate, which mainly covers the following topics:
1. **TensorFlow developer skills**
2. **Building and training Neural Network Models using TensorFlow 2.x**
3. **Computer Vision (Image Classification)**
4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
5. **Time series, sequences and predictions**

You can find my progress through the badge above.

This repository is dependent on TensorFlow 2.x based on Google Colab online platform. 
In this course, I used the free GPU service available from Coogle Colab to accelerate the model training process, 
while I am challenged by the fact of no respectable runtime and memory since there is no GPU Pro+ service provided in my region (currently the Netherlands).
