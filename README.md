# TensorFlow-Certificate-Preparation

## Updates:

I passed the example and got the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.credential.net/54a119ef-4f74-4f8d-90c2-adcd4a2b0126#gs.p7wp1k)!!!

Hard work pays off.

## Content
This is just to show my material and excercises implemented following the construction of [Zero to Mastery TensorFlow for Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/) as a preparation for Google TensorFlow Developer Certificate, which mainly covers the following topics:
1. **TensorFlow developer skills**
2. **Building and training Neural Network Models using TensorFlow 2.x**
3. **Computer Vision (Image Classification)**
4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
5. **Time series, sequences and predictions**

By completing the course and passing the TensorFlow Certification Exam, I have gained valuable knowledge and practical experience in implementing machine learning models using TensorFlow. This repository serves as a resource for anyone interested in learning about TensorFlow and gaining hands-on experience in implementing machine learning models.

## Usage
To get started with this repository, you will need to have TensorFlow and its dependencies installed on your machine. You can install TensorFlow using pip, Anaconda, or Docker.

To run any specific script, just click the badge above.

This repository is dependent on TensorFlow 2.x based on Google Colab online platform. 
In this course, I used the free GPU service available from Coogle Colab to accelerate the model training process, 
while I am challenged by the fact of no respectable runtime and memory since there is no GPU Pro+ service provided in my region (currently the Netherlands).
