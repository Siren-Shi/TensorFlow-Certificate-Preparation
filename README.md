TensorFlow Certificate Preparation
This is just to show my material and excercises implemented for the Udemy Course TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2022: Zero to Mastery, mainly covering the following topics:
1. TensorFlow developer skills
2. Building and training Neural Network Models using TensorFlow 2.x
3. Image Classification
4. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
5. Time series, sequences and predictions

This repository is dependent on TensorFlow 2.X based on Google Colab online platform. 
In this course, I used the free GPU service available from Coogle Colab to accelerate the model training process, 
while I am challenged by the fact of no GPU Pro+ service is provided in my region (currently the Netherlands).
